ChatGPT-J
=========

ChatGPT-J runs completely in the Google Colab notebook. No information is sent to an external server (except for the external server that's running the Colab Notebook).

ChatGPT-J has less restrictions than ChatGPT. Be safe.

ChatGPT-J is a user interface for a modified version of [GPT-J-6B](https://www.forefront.ai/blog-posts/gpt-j-6b-an-introduction-to-the-largest-open-sourced-gpt-model) that runs in Colab. That's called [GPT-J-6B-8bit](https://huggingface.co/hivemind/gpt-j-6B-8bit).
